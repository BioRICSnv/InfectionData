# InfectionData
Data repository for Infection study

In this repository, all data collected during our Infection study, and needed to reproduce the results described in the Nature Biomedical Engineering manuscript, is stored and accesible for verification.

Each .csv file contains 3 columns. The first column represents the datetime timestamp in the format ''. The second column contains the steps, in counts [#], recorded by the wearable Fitbit activity tarcker. Finally, the third column contains the heart rate, in beats per minute [bpm], collected by the Fitbit wearable activity tracker too. The sampling time of these datasets is either 1 or 5 min, depending on the participant.

These 3 inputs are the ones needed to run the InfectAlert algorithm.
